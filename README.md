## Integration Options

### Package Managers & Containers
* **Python SDK:** Install the [pdfrest package](https://pypi.org/project/pdfrest/) via pip. View the [Python Documentation](https://python.pdfrest.com/).
* **Docker:** Pull images from [pdfRest on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/pdfrest/pdf-api-toolkit).
* **Postman:** Fast-track testing with our [Postman Collection](https://www.postman.com/pdfrest).

### AI Automation
Connect with AI solutions to automate complex PDF operations. For example, [pdfAssistant.ai](https://pdfassistant.ai/) uses this API to provide an intelligent, chat-based PDF processing interface.

## Quick Start Guide

1.  **Get an API Key:** [Register for a free account](https://pdfrest.com/getstarted/) to receive your key (includes 100 free monthly calls).
2.  **Clone this Repo:** Use the code samples in this repository to see how to submit requests programmatically.
3.  **Configure Samples:**
    * Find the comment: `Place your api key here`
    * Replace `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx` with your actual key.

### Downloading Files
Each directory contains a `get-resource` sample. When you perform a POST call, the API returns a UUID for your file. Replace `xxxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx` in the sample with your specific UUID to download the output.

### Privacy & File Deletion
To delete sensitive files immediately after processing, edit the sample file and set its local deletion flag to `true`. This is disabled by default. 

* JavaScript: Change `const DELETE_SENSITIVE_FILES = false` to `true`
* Python: Change `DELETE_SENSITIVE_FILES = False` to `True`
* PHP: Change `$DELETE_SENSITIVE_FILES = false` to `true`
* .NET (C#): Change `var deleteSensitiveFiles = false` to `true`
* Java: Change `final boolean DELETE_SENSITIVE_FILES = false` to `true`
* cURL: Uncomment `# DELETE_SENSITIVE_FILES=true`
